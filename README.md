# Bluetooth Light Controller app

## Introduction 
The app controls Traffic lights using Bluetooth as a communication medium between an IoT device. 
The app has a very simple and basic UI.
The IoT device was installed with an Arduino chip, a bluetooth module and some LED lights for testing. 

## New Concepts Learned
- Integrating apps with hardware devices using bluetooth. 
- Using the Bluetooth Libraries 
- Using the Dart async functionality
- Working with numerous functions for bluetooth functionality.
- Setting properties to different widgets according to the state of the app. 
- Used various new widgets for layout and functionality of the app.
